# csharp-convert-ts README

This plug-in will be used to convert your c basic type to typescript type, so that the program can copy the type conversion directly from the back-end when it needs to build a model.

## Features

After copying the C type, use the right-click menu or use the shortcut key to convert the type format.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/demo.gif\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.


## Extension Settings

You can set specific types you need to convert through `contributes.configuration`

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

C Ã— type `: typescript type to be converted
